# Student_Adaptivity_Level
 In this project I have used Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict the adaptivity level of studetn. Random Forest can classify a student as Low,Moderate or High based on the input feature such as age,education,institution etc. On the other hand Logistical Regression finds out of the probability of the outcome and then classifies a student accordingly. The accuracy of model when trained with random forest algorithm and logistic regression is 0.91 and 0.69 respectively. Since the accuracy of model when trained with random forest is more than logistic regression, I used random forest here
